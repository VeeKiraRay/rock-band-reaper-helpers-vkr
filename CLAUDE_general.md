# General Helper — Script Documentation

`rock_band_general_helper_vkr.lua` provides Rock Band authoring utilities: tempo map generation from drum audio, audio track alignment, and VENUE event validation.

Read `CLAUDE.md` first for shared architecture, conventions, and Lua specifics.

---

## How the script is used

Three tabs, each self-contained:

**General tab** — audio alignment and settings persistence.
- **Align all audio** — aligns every audio item on every track to a common reference position.
- **Align count-in** — positions the COUNT IN clip relative to the first measure.
- Save / Load buttons for project-scoped settings.

**Tempo Map tab** — generate a REAPER tempo map from drum audio analysis.
1. Set the four source track dropdowns (KICK, SNARE, KIT, Fallback). Any can be left as "(none)".
2. Use **Show context** to check what the project's tempo marker currently says for the time selection start.
3. Use **Align audio** to align the drum audio tracks before analysis.
4. Use **Estimate initial BPM** to detect BPM and time signature from the audio (read-only).
5. Apply the estimated BPM manually to the project if needed.
6. Use **Generate tempo map** to insert REAPER tempo markers at detected downbeats.
7. Use **Clear generated markers** to remove auto-generated markers and start over.

**Venue tab** — VENUE MIDI track validation.
- **List venue events** — validates the VENUE track against the Rock Band Network spec: track name event, event type checks, unknown events, consecutive camera repeats, directed cut spacing, camera gap statistics, event usage frequency.

**`TrackCombo` local override.** The general helper uses `sel_idx = -1` to mean "no track configured" for drum source dropdowns. The lib's `TrackCombo` always expects a non-negative index. `ui.lua` defines a local `TrackCombo` that adds a `(none)` selectable entry and handles -1, shadowing the global for that file only.

### Save / Load

Section `RBHelperVKR`, key `settings_v1`. Auto-loads on script open.

**Saved:** all tempo map sliders (`tm_rms_threshold`, `tm_rms_window_ms`, `tm_search_window_ms`, `tm_drift_threshold_ms`, `tm_bpm_failsafe`, `tm_first_measure`, `tm_timesig_num`, `tm_override_failsafe`).
**Not saved:** track indices (`tm_kick_idx`, `tm_snare_idx`, `tm_kit_idx`, `tm_fallback_idx`) — positional, brittle. `SetDefaultTempoTracks` re-detects them by name on each open.

## Feature: Generate tempo map

### Overview

Two read/write phases:

1. **Estimate initial BPM** (read-only) — detects onsets from the drum audio, estimates BPM via inter-onset interval analysis, and guesses the time signature. Reports results; writes nothing.
2. **Generate tempo map** — inserts REAPER tempo markers. Uses the existing project tempo marker as a phase anchor, propagates a beat grid forward measure-by-measure, and inserts a new marker only where the detected downbeat deviates from the expected position by more than the drift threshold.

### Design decisions

**Anchor-based approach, not blind beat tracking.** The standard workflow aligns the drum audio so that the first true downbeat lands at the configured start measure (default: measure 3). Because REAPER knows where that measure starts (`TimeMap2_beatsToTime`), the phase is given — no phase-detection step needed. The algorithm confirms and tracks the grid forward from that anchor.

**Measure-level markers only.** The community standard is one tempo marker per measure; skip measures where the drums appear on time. Beat-level (four per bar) is a future enhancement.

**Self-correcting grid propagation.** Each detected downbeat becomes the new reference for the next expected downbeat. Slight early/late errors don't accumulate — they're absorbed by the new marker.

**Fallback audio source chain.** Priority: KICK → SNARE → KIT → Fallback. For each analysis window, the highest-priority source with a detected signal is used. Fallbacks exist for sections where kick/snare are absent (intros, transitions, quiet passages).

**Time signature from preceding project marker.** On full-song runs, read the marker at time 0. On time-selection runs, read the last marker at or before `sel_start`. Implemented by iterating all markers and keeping the last one whose `timepos ≤ query time`. User can override the numerator via a slider (0 = inherit).

**Failsafe stops on large BPM drift.** If the instantaneous BPM implied by two consecutive detected downbeats deviates from the initial BPM by more than `bpm_failsafe` (default ±10), generation stops and reports the position and measured BPM. The "Override limit" checkbox bypasses this for intentional large tempo changes.

**Drift threshold controls marker density.** A marker is inserted only when `|detected_time - expected_time| > drift_threshold_ms`. At the 30 ms default, on-time measures produce no marker.

**Remove-then-reinsert within range, not skip-existing.** Before inserting, `GenerateTempoMap` deletes all existing tempo markers where `timepos >= t_s AND timepos < t_e` (iterating in reverse). Re-running is idempotent. Markers before `t_s` (including the root marker at t=0) are never touched.

### REAPER APIs used

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `r.CountTempoTimeSigMarkers(proj)` | Count existing markers |
| `r.GetTempoTimeSigMarker(proj, idx)` | Read a marker: `(ok, timepos, measurepos, beatpos, bpm, num, denom, linear)` |
| `r.AddTempoTimeSigMarker(proj, timepos, bpm, num, denom, linear)` | Insert a tempo marker — **REAPER snaps `timepos` to the nearest beat boundary of the current tempo map**. To place a marker at a specific audio time T, the prior marker must carry a BPM that makes T an exact beat boundary (see two-pass insertion below). |
| `r.DeleteTempoTimeSigMarker(proj, idx)` | Delete a marker (iterate in reverse) |
| `r.TimeMap2_beatsToTime(proj, n)` | Project beats → project time (n = total beats from project start) |
| `r.TimeMap2_timeToBeats(proj, t)` | Project time → beats |
| `r.GetAudioAccessorSamples(...)` | Read PCM samples from audio item |
| `r.CreateTakeAudioAccessor(take)` / `r.DestroyAudioAccessor(aa)` | Audio I/O — always free the accessor |
| `r.new_array(n)` | Sample buffer allocation (1-based, main Lua thread only) |

`TimeMap2_beatsToTime` counts from the project's beat grid. To find the start of measure N in 4/4: `beat_pos = (N - 1) * 4`, then `timepos = r.TimeMap2_beatsToTime(proj, beat_pos)`. For other time sigs, use the numerator in place of 4.

### State fields (`S`)

```lua
-- Persisted
S.tm_rms_threshold      = 0.15   -- onset detection threshold (higher than vocal; kick stems are louder/cleaner)
S.tm_rms_window_ms      = 10     -- RMS window in ms (short for drums)
S.tm_search_window_ms   = 100    -- max ms either side of expected beat to search
S.tm_drift_threshold_ms = 30     -- min deviation (ms) before inserting a marker
S.tm_bpm_failsafe       = 10     -- stop if BPM drifts > this from initial
S.tm_first_measure      = 3      -- measure number where the first marker is generated
S.tm_timesig_num        = 0      -- override numerator (0 = inherit from project marker)
S.tm_override_failsafe  = false  -- bypass BPM failsafe

-- Not persisted — auto-detected by name on load
S.tm_kick_idx           = -1
S.tm_snare_idx          = -1
S.tm_kit_idx            = -1
S.tm_fallback_idx       = -1
```

### Algorithm detail

#### `ComputeTempoRMSContour`
Simplified variant of the vocal script's `ComputeRMSContour`. No LPF pass (drums are broadband). Channels are averaged. Uses the same audio accessor + `new_array` + sliding window pattern. Returns `{contour, t_start, t_step}` or `nil, error`.

#### `DetectOnsets`
Peak picker over the RMS contour. For each run above threshold: walk forward until the value drops, record the start of the run as the onset (first-crossing heuristic — drum transients rise fast). Enforce `min_gap_s` by discarding detections within the gap of the last accepted onset.

#### `EstimateBPM`
1. Compute adjacent IOIs from the onset list.
2. Convert each IOI to BPM: `bpm = 60 / ioi`.
3. Also vote for `bpm/2` and `bpm×2` (half-time/double-time harmonics).
4. Bin all votes into a 1-BPM-wide histogram from `BPM_MIN` (60) to `BPM_MAX` (250).
5. Return the histogram peak and `consistent_count / (onset_count - 1)` as confidence.

**Project BPM independence.** `EstimateBPM` is purely IOI-based — it only looks at time differences between consecutive onsets. The project's current tempo marker has no effect on the BPM calculation. What *does* affect behavior: when no time selection is active, `EstimateInitialBPM` scans measure-by-measure using `GetMeasureStartTime` (which calls `TimeMap2_beatsToTime`). If the project BPM differs greatly from the song BPM, the scan windows cover wrong time spans. Failure modes at very large deviations (~±80 BPM):
- **Project BPM too low** — wide project measures, many onsets per window, harder stability check.
- **Project BPM too high** — narrow project measures may exhaust the intro before any drum is found.
Workaround: use a time selection over a known drum section, or apply a rough tempo marker first.

#### `GuessTimeSig`
Given `beat_dur` and `onset_times`:
1. Snap the anchor to the nearest onset within 50 ms.
2. For each candidate numerator `{4, 3, 6}`:
   a. Compute `measure_dur = num × beat_dur`.
   b. Count onsets that fall within ±`beat_dur × 0.25` of beat 0.
   c. Score = `count × num / #onsets`.
3. The numerator with the highest score wins.
4. IOI 4-beat override: if the winner is not 4/4, count consecutive-onset pairs spaced `4 × beat_dur` apart (±15%). Two or more such pairs override to 4/4.
5. Minimum evidence threshold: if winner ≠ 4/4 and `best_score < 1.25`, override to 4/4. Genuine 3/4 scores ≥ 1.5; evenly-spaced kicks produce ~1.05 (noise, not real evidence).

#### `FitBeatGrid`
```
t = anchor_t
while next expected downbeat is within analysis range:
    next_exp = t + num × beat_dur
    search onsets in [next_exp − search_window, next_exp + search_window]
    require onset at least beat_dur × (num − 0.5) ahead of t  ← minimum-advance guard
    if found:
        step_dur = (found_t − t) / num
        grid[i] = {expected_t, detected_t, deviation_s, bpm = 60/step_dur, source}
        t = found_t
    else:
        grid[i] = {expected_t, detected_t=nil, deviation_s=nil, bpm=current_bpm, source=nil}
        t = next_exp
```

The minimum-advance guard (`beat_dur × (num - 0.5)`) prevents snapping to beat-4 kicks or subdivisions when the onset list is dense — see the known bug fix below.

#### Time selection boundary rules

**Do not change these without discussion — established from user feedback.**

**Start boundary.** First generated measure:
- If `sel_s` is within 1 ms of a measure downbeat → that measure is the first (inclusive).
- Otherwise → first complete measure boundary *after* `sel_s`.
- Implementation: use `format_timestr_pos(sel_s, '', 1)` for current measure number, compare `sel_s` against `GetMeasureStartTime(current_measure)` with 1 ms tolerance.
- **Do NOT use `TimeMap2_timeToBeats`** — it returns beats within the current measure (0–num), not total beats.

**End boundary.** Last generated measure:
- If `sel_e` is within 1 ms of a measure downbeat → that measure IS included (inclusive end).
- Otherwise → last complete measure whose downbeat falls within the selection.
- `FitBeatGrid` must use `t <= sel_e + 0.001` (not strict `<`).

**No time selection.** Use `S.tm_first_measure` as the anchor. Analysis range = full audio item.

#### `GenerateTempoMap` algorithm
1. Validate: at least one tempo marker exists in the project.
2. Get `bpm0, num, denom` via `GetTempoContextBefore`.
3. Compute `first_gen_measure` from time selection start (boundary rules above), or use `S.tm_first_measure`.
4. Get `measure_start_t` via `GetMeasureStartTime(first_gen_measure, num)`.
5. Detect onsets from all source tracks via `GetSourcesForRange`.
6. `grid = FitBeatGrid(...)`.
7. **Pass 1 (collect):** iterate grid, apply drift threshold and failsafe check, collect insert positions.
8. **Pass 2 (BPM assignment):** for each insert position, compute span from prior marker to this one, covering N measures. `bpm = N × num × 60 / span`. N estimated as `round(span / measure_dur_est)` — necessary because on-time intermediate measures produce no marker, so naive N=1 gives a BPM N× too low.
9. Delete existing markers in range (reverse order), then insert in forward order.
10. Report: markers inserted, measures scanned, failsafe triggered (if any).

### Known bug (fixed) — FitBeatGrid wrong-onset snapping and REAPER marker snapping

**Symptom.** With a low RMS threshold (detecting beats 1–4, not just downbeats), `GenerateTempoMap` placed markers at wrong positions. High threshold (downbeat-only) worked correctly.

**Root cause 1 — wrong onset snapping.** When every beat is detected, two candidates can fall within `±search_window` at each grid step: the beat-4 kick of the current measure (closer if BPM estimate is slightly off) and the beat-1 kick of the next measure. FitBeatGrid would snap to beat-4, place a marker there, and all subsequent steps inherited the wrong phase.

**Fix:** minimum-advance guard — only accept onsets at least `beat_dur × (num - 0.5)` ahead of the previous anchor.

**Root cause 2 — REAPER marker snapping.** `AddTempoTimeSigMarker` snaps `timepos` to the nearest beat boundary of the *current* tempo map. Even when FitBeatGrid found the correct onset, the marker landed at `expected_t` (the beat boundary) rather than `detected_t` (the actual onset) if the anchor BPM was slightly wrong.

**Fix:** two-pass insertion. Collect all insert positions first, then compute each marker's BPM so that the *next* insert position is an exact beat boundary under that BPM. Insert in forward order.

**Root cause 3 — N-measures BPM error.** When intermediate measures are on-time (below drift threshold), no marker is inserted for them. A span covering N measures with naive `60 × num / span` (assuming N=1) gives a BPM N× too low.

**Fix:** estimate N as `round(span / measure_dur_est)` and use `N × num × 60 / span`.

### Things on the radar

- **Auto-scan for a usable analysis window.** When no time selection is active and the initial window (starting at `S.tm_first_measure`) returns 0 onsets, automatically slide forward in 5-measure increments up to measure 20. If a window with onsets is found, use it and report which measures were scanned. Cap at measure 20 to keep this O(N) and fast. The "First measure" slider remains the explicit preferred control.
- **Beat-level markers.** Currently only measure-level. Beat-level (4 per bar) would improve resolution for rubato or live recordings.
- **Time signature auto-detection edge cases.** The heuristic is reliable for 4/4 and 3/4. Unusual signatures (5/4, 7/8) should always be verified manually.

### Known limitations

- Beat-level markers not generated; only measure starts.
- Time signature detection is a heuristic; always verify for unusual signatures.
- Large project BPM mismatch (>~80 BPM off) can cause incorrect or missing results from `EstimateInitialBPM` when no time selection is active. Use a time selection over a known drum section, or apply a rough tempo marker first.
- RMS contour computed synchronously — UI freezes during analysis of long sections (same constraint as vocal auto-tune; see `CLAUDE.md` Lua specifics).
- If no onset is found near an expected downbeat (gap section, quiet intro), the grid extrapolates at current BPM with no marker. User should verify those sections manually.

## Feature: VENUE validation

`ListVenueEvents` reads the VENUE MIDI track and reports:

1. **Track name event (type 3).** Must be exactly one, at PPQ 0, with message `"VENUE"`.
2. **Unexpected event types.** All non-track-name events should be type 1 (Text). Any other types are listed with their type name.
3. **Unknown events.** Each text event is checked against `VENUE_VALID` (the full Rock Band Network event table in `defaults.lua`). Unknown events are listed.
4. **Consecutive camera repeats.** Any `[coop...]` or `[directed...]` event that immediately follows an identical event.
5. **Directed cut spacing.** Any `[directed...]` event whose next camera event starts within `DIRECTED_GAP_MIN` (2.0 s). Listed with position, event text, gap duration, and what follows.
6. **Camera gap statistics.** Average, slowest, and fastest cut durations for: coop→any transitions, and directed→coop transitions.
7. **Event usage frequency.** All text events sorted by usage count descending.

### `VENUE_VALID`

A large constant table in `defaults.lua` listing every known valid VENUE text event string. When a text event is not in this table, it's reported as unrecognized. The table is not automatically updated — it must be maintained manually as the Rock Band Network spec evolves.

## Glossary

- **Onset** — the moment a drum hit begins; specifically where audio energy rises sharply above background. Onset times are the raw input to BPM estimation and beat-grid fitting.
- **IOI (inter-onset interval)** — time between two consecutive onsets. Converting IOIs to BPM (`60 / ioi`) and histogramming them is how `EstimateBPM` finds the dominant tempo without reference to the project's tempo map.
- **Downbeat** — the first beat of a measure (beat 1). `FitBeatGrid` specifically searches for downbeats, not all beats. Markers are placed at downbeat positions.
- **Beat grid** — the expected sequence of downbeat times, computed by stepping forward from an anchor by `num × beat_dur` per measure. When a detected onset is near an expected downbeat, that onset becomes the new anchor.
- **Drift threshold** — the minimum deviation (ms) between a detected downbeat and the expected beat-grid position that triggers a new tempo marker. Below the threshold the measure is considered on-time.
- **Contour** — the sequence of per-window RMS values over an audio item. The onset detector runs over this contour, not raw samples.
- **RMS window** — the length of audio (ms) averaged into one contour value. Shorter = finer time resolution, sharper onset edges; longer = smoother.
- **Tempo marker** — a REAPER project object that sets BPM and time signature from a given project time forward. The root marker at index 0 is always present; `ClearGeneratedTempoMarkers` preserves it.
- **VENUE** — a special MIDI track in Rock Band charts carrying camera cut, lighting, and post-processing text events. Events must match the Rock Band Network specification exactly; unknown events cause compile errors.
